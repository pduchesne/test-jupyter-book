# Preface

This document contains the comprehensive client partnerâ€™s guide for OpenSearch, as adopted in
the CEOS WGISS Connected Data Assets project. The document introduces the architecture
background and required skills to be a client, the query interface, and an implementation outline.
Several detailed use cases about how to retrieve the IDN (International Directory Network)
collection ID and how to interact with the WGISS Connected Assets Granule Gateway servers are
also included in this document.

Future versions of the book are expected to cover additional topics including:

- Accessing connected data assets using STAC
